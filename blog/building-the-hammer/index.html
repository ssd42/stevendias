                <p>Engineers spend years learning how to build a hammer.</p>

                <p>We learn to shape things that are fast, stable, and elegant. We chase cleaner abstractions, better patterns, and smarter architecture. We study the craft of building things that work beautifully and hold up under pressure.</p>

                <p>But most of us never learn how to use the hammer.</p>

                <p>We build systems that scale to thousands, handle payments in seconds, and keep data safe across the globe, but rarely stop to ask who actually needs what we're building, or why. We know how to make the thing, but not how to make it matter.</p>

                <p>Modern teams make that easy to overlook. Roles are clearly drawn. Engineers build. Product decides. Marketing sells. The separation keeps things efficient, but it also keeps us narrow. We become experts in the mechanism and strangers to its purpose.</p>

                <p>We've mastered how to make a great hammer, but not what to build with it.</p>
