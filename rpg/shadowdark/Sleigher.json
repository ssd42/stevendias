Miracles are risky; failure may lock miracles or cause judicial/divine consequences rather than wrath. Holy symbol is a gavel, representing finality and verdict. Vampiric Curse (Narrative): Vampiric Bite—Sleigher may bite a helpless, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature. Not a standard attack. Deals 1d4 damage; Sleigher heals 1 HP OR gains advantage on his next WIS-based miracle. Each use is considered a recorded judgment and may carry moral, social, or divine consequences at the GM’s discretion.",
